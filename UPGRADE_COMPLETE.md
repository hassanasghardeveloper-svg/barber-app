# 🚀 Real Database Upgrade Complete!

I have connected your app to the Vercel Database you created.
This means:
1.  **Shared Memory:** Phones and Laptops will now see the *same* data.
2.  **Permanent:** Data won't disappear when you refresh.
3.  **Real Emails:** The system now tracks real email addresses.

## ✅ What to do now?
1.  **Wait 2 minutes** for Vercel to auto-deploy (since I just pushed the code).
2.  **Go to your website** (`barber-app-5hdo.vercel.app` or similar).
3.  **Log in to Admin** (`admin@barber.com` / `admin`).
    *   It will be EMPTY (This is normal! It's a new database).
4.  **Open `/book` on your phone** (or Incognito window).
5.  **Book an appointment**.
    *   Watch it appear instantly on your Admin Dashboard! 🪄

## ⚠️ If Emails fail:
*   Make sure you added `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` to Vercel Environment Variables.
