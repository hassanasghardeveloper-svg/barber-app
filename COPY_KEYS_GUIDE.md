2.  Click the **"Show secret"** toggle (eye icon) above the code box.
3.  Click the **"Copy Snippet"** icon (or select all text and copy).

## 2. Paste them
1.  Open your VS Code.
2.  Open the file named **`.env.local`**.
3.  **Paste** the copied text at the bottom of that file.
4.  Save the file (`Ctrl+S`).

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you keep your Gmail keys at the top! New keys go below them.
