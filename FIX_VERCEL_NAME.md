# ❌ Error: "Project already exists"

The red box says:
> *"Project 'barber-app' already exists, please use a new name."*

This means you (or Vercel) already tried to create a project named `barber-app` (perhaps in the previous failed attempt).

### ✅ The Fix: Change the Name
1.  Look at the box near the top labeled **"Project Name"**.
2.  It currently says `barber-app`.
3.  **Change it** to something unique, like:
    *   `barber-app-v2`
    *   `hassan-barber-shop`
    *   `premium-cuts-app`
4.  Then click **Deploy** again.

It will work instantly because your settings are all correct!
