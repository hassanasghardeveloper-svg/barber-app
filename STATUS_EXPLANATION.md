# ⏳ "Another build is in progress" - What it means

This is **GOOD** news. It means Vercel is working on it!

### 🔍 What is happening?
You likely clicked "Deploy" or "Redeploy", and at the same time, Vercel detected the new code I sent to GitHub.
So now there are two "jobs" in the line.

**"Queued"** means it is waiting for its turn.

### ✅ What to do?
**Do absolutely nothing.**
Just wait 1-2 minutes.
It will automatically change from "Queued" to "Building" and then to "Ready".

You can sit back and relax. Your app is launching! 🚀
