# ❌ Error: "fatal: not a git repository"

The screenshot shows you are in the **wrong folder**.
Your terminal says `~` (which means Home), but your project is inside `Project-hassan`.

## ✅ The Fix (2 Steps)

Type these **TWO** commands in your terminal, hitting **Enter** after each one:

### Command 1: Go to the folder
```bash
cd "Project-hassan/barber whatsapp helper"
```

### Command 2: Send the code
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

---

*(After Command 2, it should work. Go back to GitHub and refresh!)*
