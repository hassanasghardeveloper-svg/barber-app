# 📤 How to Upload Your Code to GitHub

You are currently seeing the "Quick Setup" page because your repository is empty. You need to send the files from your computer to GitHub.

## ✅ The Only Command You Need

1.  Open the **Terminal** in Visual Studio Code (at the bottom of your screen).
2.  Type this exact command and press **Enter**:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 What if it asks for a password?
If a box pops up:
1.  **Sign in with your browser** (it's the easiest way).
2.  Click "Authorize" if asked.

---

## 🏁 How to check if it worked?
1.  Wait for the command to finish (it will say something like `Writing objects: 100%`).
2.  Go back to your Google Chrome window (the one in your screenshot).
3.  **Refresh the page** (Press F5).
4.  You should now see a list of files (`src`, `package.json`, etc.) instead of the setup instructions.

**Once you see the files on GitHub, go back to Vercel and click "Deploy" again.**
