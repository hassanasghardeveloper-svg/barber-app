# ✅ You are close! Here is the fix.

Looking at your screenshot (Step Id: 467):
1.  **Good News:** You are ALREADY in the correct folder! (I see `(main)` in blue, which means Git is ready).
2.  **The Mistake:** You typed `push -u origin main` but forgot the word `git`.

---

## 🚀 Run this EXACT command:

Type this and press **Enter**:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

*(Make sure you type `git` at the start!)*
