# 🗄️ Which Database to Choose?

In your screenshot, you see many options.
You should choose the **FIRST** one:

## 1. Click "Neon (Serverless Postgres)"
*   It is the **top option** in the list (the black logo with the green 'N').
*   *(This is the standard database engine for Vercel).*

## 2. Click "Continue"
*   Button at the bottom right.

## 3. Accept & Create
*   Accept the terms (if asked).
*   Click **"Create"** or **"Add Integration"**.
*   Wait a few seconds for it to finish.

## 4. Get the Keys (Secrets)
*   Once it is created, you will see a page with green checkmarks or "Connected".
*   Click **".env.local"** on the left menu (or look for "Quickstart").
*   Click **"Show Secret"**.
*   **Copy Everything**.
*   Paste it into your `.env.local` file in VS Code.

**Then tell me "Done"!**
